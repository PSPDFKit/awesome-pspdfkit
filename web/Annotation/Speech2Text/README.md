# Text2Speech

This project enables speech-to-text functionality, allowing you to speak and convert your speech into text using browser APIs. The generated text is copied to the clipboard and then used to create text annotations directly on a PDF.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or later)
- npm (version 6 or later)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Narashiman-K/Speech2Text.git
   cd Speech2Text

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the project dependencies:
    ```bash

4.  Copy the PSPDFKit for Web library assets to the public directory by running:
    ```bash
    cp -R ./node_modules/pspdfkit/dist/pspdfkit-lib public/pspdfkit-lib

5. You should now be able to run the project locally by executing:
    ```bash
    npm run dev

6. Click on the "Start Speech to Text" button and ensure you allow microphone access in your web browser. Click the button and start talking. Once you stop, the text annotation will be placed on the PDF.
