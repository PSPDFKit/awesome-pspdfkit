# Annotation Comments POC

This is a proof-of-concept project showcasing the usage of comment linked to annotations automatically with PSPDFKit. Please note that this project is built using a nightly build version of PSPDFKit. For production applications, we recommend using the official stable version.

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Siddharth2001-July/annotation-comments
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd annotation-comments
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Add the required assets:

```bash
npm run add-assets
```

5. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

That's it! You can now access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8080.
#### Note
Make sure that your system has the global `serve` package installed. You can check if it's already installed by running `serve --version` in your terminal.
